# Inventory Management System

## Description:
The purpose of this project is to create an application for any merchant that needs an inventory management system. The scope of this project includes adding new items as well as viewing stock, recording items sold, recording items purchased, recording damaged items, viewing records of items purchased, sold, damaged, and a calculator. The actual financial processing is out of the scope of this project, as these functions are handled by another system.

## Description of how to set up and run:
Download the entire Final_project_InventoryManagementSystem file directly and put it into the IDE (IntelliJ IDEA is recommended) to run it. No database is used, so there is no need to serialize the database.
